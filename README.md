node-export-mongo-results-to-text
---
Got tired of clearing all the special characters and objects that gets generated by my mongodb client when doing an export so I wrote this for when I needed valid JSON objects for my mongo results.

Pretty straight forward.

Modify the code for your db connection needs and put in your regular mongo query. Results will be saved to ```test.txt```.
